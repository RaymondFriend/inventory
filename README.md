# Eberly College of Science 2019 GHG Emissions Inventory

In an effort to quantify The Penn State University's Eberly College of Science's total carbon-equivalent emissions across a year, I was tasked with the responsibility of performing an inventory of every significant source of greenhouse gas emissions related to the College's activities. 

I determined that the Eberly College of Science produced **28,152** metric tons of CO2-equivalent through its various operations during Calendar Year 2019. 

The College's greenhouse gas inventory documentation presents a breakdown of emissions arising from utility use, air travel, commuting, University Fleet leased and rented vehicles, vended supplies, high performance computing, and other sources. This report is the first work of its kind for Eberly College of Science, and only the second unit-level GHG inventory to be performed across The Pennsylvania State University. I recommend that the College repeat this inventory on a regular basis as a metric of success in reducing its emissions of climate-damaging greenhouse gases and urge College leaders to explore the opportunities for action. Achieving greater sustainability and resilience will require a combination of systematic and individual actions across ECoS.

You can find the full report and calculation spreadsheet in this repository.
